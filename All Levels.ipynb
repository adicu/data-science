    "We'll cover the fundamentals of data science through an in-depth exercise on a fun dataset containing boba places in Manhattan. At the end of this track, you'll have been exposed to data acquisition with the Google Maps and Foursquare APIs, data prep and cleaning with `pandas` and `numpy`, geospatial data visualization, and text analysis with `nltk`!\n",

    "## What do I need to get started?\n",

    "But before we even get started, we have to set our environment up. This guide was written in Python 3.6. If you haven't already, download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). Once you have Python and Pip installed, clone [this repo](https://github.com/adicu/data-science) using Git as follows:\n",

    "```\n",

    "```\n",

    "We'll be using the [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key) and [Foursquare](https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api/getting-started) APIs, so make sure to generate your API keys. Since we’ll be working with Python throughout, using the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) is the best way to get the most out of this tutorial. Once you have your notebook up and running, you can download all the data for this post from [GitHub](https://github.com/adicu/devfest-data-science).

    "For those of you who are unfamiliar with Jupyter notebooks, I’ve provided a brief review of which functions will be particularly useful to move along with this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the image below, you’ll see three buttons labeled 1-3 that will be important for you to get a grasp of -- the save button (1), add cell button (2), and run cell button (3). \n",

    "![ alt text](https://www.twilio.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/qwigKpOsph32AcwRNBGAPyPf885eso4nSOungzHEaJ5cZceEH6R9AwN9ZQi1UX2K4DWK2NvvQYA5napOIz-pcfg6YzdCqSNGQUPv9bR1poJ6Pd3nUrToZ1DP3wRHZhiE_DbFbLsz.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first button is the button you’ll use to **save your work** as you go along (1). Feel free to choose when to save your work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we have the **“add cell”** button (2). Cells are blocks of code that you can run together. These are the building blocks of jupyter notebook because it provides the option of running code incrementally without having to to run all your code at once.  Throughout this tutorial, you’ll see lines of code blocked off -- each one should correspond to a cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, there’s the **“run cell”** button (3). Jupyter Notebook doesn’t automatically run it your code for you; you have to tell it when by clicking this button. As with add button, once you’ve written each block of code in this tutorial onto your cell, you should then run it to see the output (if any). If any output is expected, note that it will also be shown in this tutorial so you know what to expect. _Make sure to run your code as you go along because many blocks of code in this tutorial rely on previous cells._\n"

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "You've likely heard the phrase 'data science' at some point of your life. Whether that be in the news, in a statistics or computer science course, or during your walk over to ferris for lunch. To demystify the term, let's first ask ourselves _what do we mean by data?_ \n",
    "\n",
    "Data is another ambiguous term, but more so because it can encompass so much. Anything that can be collected or transcribed can be data, whether it's numerical, text, images, sounds, anything!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Data Science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Science is where computer science and statistics intersect to solve problems involving sets of data. This can be simple statistical analysis like using R to compute means, medians, standard deviations for a numerical dataset, but it can also mean creating robust algorithms for artificial intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, it's taking techniques developed in the areas of statistics and math and using them to learn from some sort of data source. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Is data science the same as machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "While they do have overlap, they are not the same! The ultimate goal of data science is to use data for some sort of insight, and that _can_ often include learning how to do prediction from historical data. But it's not the full picture. Visualization, data acquisition and storage are just as important as using machine learning to \"predict the future.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is Data Science important? \n",
    "\n",
    "Data Science has so much potential! By using data in creative and innovative ways, we can gain a lot of insight on the world, whether that be in economics, biology, sociology, math - any topic you can think of, data science has its own unique application. \n"
